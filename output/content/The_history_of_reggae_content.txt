**Title: Lee Scratch Perry's Journey Through the History of Reggae**

**Introduction:**
Hey, it's me, Lee Scratch Perry, the Upsetter! I'm here to take you on a ride through the history of reggae, the music that's been my life's work. We're gonna explore how this sound came to be, from the roots to the branches, and I'll share some of my own experiences along the way. So, let's get started, and remember, music is a journey, not just a destination.

**The Roots: Ska and Rocksteady**

Reggae didn't just appear out of thin air, you know. It grew from the fertile ground of Jamaica's earlier music styles, ska and rocksteady. Ska was lively and upbeat, the heartbeat of the streets in the early '60s. It was the sound of independence, of Jamaica breaking free from colonial rule. I remember those days, the energy in the air, and how the music brought people together.

Then came rocksteady, a bit slower, a bit more soulful. It was the music of the late '60s, and it set the stage for what was to come. Rocksteady was where the basslines started to take over, and that's a crucial part of reggae. I was right there, soaking it all in, and using it to shape my own sound.

**The Birth of Reggae**

Now, let's talk about the birth of reggae. It was around 1968 when the term 'reggae' started being used. The sound was slower than rocksteady, with a heavy emphasis on the offbeat, the 'skank.' It was the music of the people, reflecting the struggles and joys of life in Jamaica.

I was at the forefront of this movement, working in the studio, experimenting with sounds, and pushing the boundaries. My time at Studio One with Coxsone Dodd was pivotal. It's where I learned the craft, and where I started to upset the status quo. I was creating music that was raw, real, and revolutionary.

**The Rise of Dub**

And then there's dub, my special baby. Dub is the art of remixing and transforming existing tracks into something new and experimental. It's where I really let my creativity run wild. I was using the mixing board like a musical instrument, adding effects, and creating space for the listener to get lost in the sound.

Dub became a huge part of reggae, influencing not just music but also
